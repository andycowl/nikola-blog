Although hosting on GitHub pages is an excellent option, I decided to
move this blog to Amazon [[https://aws.amazon.com/s3/][S3]], mainly because I have used S3
before. Also GitHub pages only supports a limited set of Jekyll
[[https://help.github.com/articles/adding-jekyll-plugins-to-a-github-pages-site/][plugins]] and I wanted more flexibility to add any plugin and
(potentially) run a different version of Jekyll.

I also took the opportunity to switch the theme to the rather
minimalistic but stylish [[http://getpoole.com/][Poole]] and installed the useful [[https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website][s3website]]
utility to automatically synchronise the static site to amazon S3. As
you are charged for upload/download traffic, an intelligent sync
process (rather than uploading everything) for deployment is
important.
