One of the best things about my job is that you can are free to use
Linux and any email client you please. I use [[https://www.oracle.com/linux/index.html][Oracle Linux 7]] and
[[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/][Thunderbird]] on my Lenovo T420 laptop.

Over the years I have used a variety of email clients. When I was
compelled to use a Windows machine, I was normally forced to use
Outlook or Thunderbird (if possible). Between 1996 and 2003, I used
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] and [[http://www.gnus.org/][Gnus]] which was pretty unusual and perplexed many colleagues.

I really loved Gnus as I already used it to read Usenet newsgroups
(remember them ?) and it just seemed like a completely natural
extension to use the same interface to rapidly consume and compose
email. Also, it has the most brilliant, funny and entertaining
computer [[http://www.gnus.org/manual.html][manual]] ever written courtesy of [[http://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/][Lars]] Magne Ingebrigtsen.

Once, when invited by my employer to 'Make a difference' in a crowd
sourced effort to reduce inefficiency and improve profitability, I
suggested that we convert all internal forums and mailing lists to
internal newsgroups hosted on a central NNTP news server. I once read
that a single email cost a company ten cents. While this doesn't sound
a lot, calculations showed that for 3,500 employees and 500 mailing
lists, this figure soon grows exponentially.

How much easier for everyone to read corporate edicts or technical
forums from a central server. Anyway, the powers that be didn't choose
to dignify my proposal with an acknowledgement, still less a reasoned
response. Still, I had the last laugh, they filed for bankruptcy two
years later citing an 'large, unwieldly, unscaleable and prohibitively
expensive email infrastructure'.

Anyway, I digress slightly. I happily use Thunderbird with the
[[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/projects/calendar/][Lightning]] calendar extension which all works fine.

Then I saw a YouTube talk about the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBs_P_1--Os][Notmuch]] email client which looked
like a stripped down attempt to emulate GMail with a terminal based
interface where labels are applied to messages, messages are never
deleted and powerful, accurate, fast searching is key.

This set me thinking (always dangerous). Email is a key element of my
working day; I spend a significant proportion of my time processing
email. Why I don't revert to an Emacs email client so I can read and
send emails from the one true editor instead of constantly context
switching ?

I researched [[https://notmuchmail.org/][Notmuch]] a little more. I liked the fact it was simple and
expressly de-coupled from the other email components - 'do one job, do
it well'. Notmuch doesn't collect email from the server nor does it
send email. Notmuch simply indexes the email and searches it -
quickly.

I soon encountered another similar, bare-bones, stripped down mail
indexing tool with an emacs client that was getting lots of positive
reviews - [[http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/][mu4e]].

I always maintain you can't solely rely on reviews as that relies on
other people. Despite being innately lazy, you really have to try
software for yourself and live with it for a period to fully evaluate
it so that's what I decided to do.

Firstly, I discovered that these mail indexers prefer [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir][Maildir]] format
which uses a file for each individual message whereas Thunderbird uses
a single [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox][mbox]] file per folder. Funnily enough, that explained my
backups constantly transfer a large, monolithic 'Sent' mailbox file
when only a couple of new messages had been added.

So the first problem was to convert all my Thunderbird 'Local
Folders', spanning 13 years, to Maildir format. No problem, it's a
common issue and there were a plethora of mbox to maildir [[http://www.qmail.org/top.html#usersoft][converters]]
available.

However, a lot of these utilities were ancient, broken or obsolete. I
had various errors; silent failures, compilation errors, date parsing
problems, incomplete conversions, seemingly random failures. Clearly
all the clever people migrated to Maildir a long, long time ago.

There was a promising import/export [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools/][extension]] for Thunderbird that had
a tantalising Changelog entry referring to Maildir format but that
also proved to be a non-starter.

The idea had now been seeded so I certainly wasn't going to be
deterred by having a mere 49,339 email messages in the incorrect
format. I saw a blog post detailing how to use the open source [[http://dovecot.org/][Dovecot]]
Mail server to convert email between a variety of different formats.

The dovecot package was in the OL7 repos and it was trivial to
configure a local IMAP server. Then I simply copied each Thunderbird
folder to a newly created, local IMAP account which created the
messages in Maildir format. This was very fast and meant I could
easily check the number of converted messages was correct both in
Thunderbird and on the file system.

I kept the legacy email and Dovecot around as it was useful for
reconcilation and testing purposes and represented the fallback plan
if I subsequently needed to revert to Thunderbird. Although
Thunderbird appears to have embryonic, experimental [[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird/Maildir][Maildir]] support,
there are some pretty dire warnings such as:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  'HOWEVER, note this is NOT full maildir in the sense that most people,
  particularly linux users or mail administrators, know as maildir. You
  cannot point a Thunderbird account to a mail server directory. You do
  not get message flags stored with emails. You only get a single file
  per message, and nothing more'.
#+END_QUOTE

So that was that - although this quick, fun, post-lunch task took
slightly longer than originally anticipated, now I had successfully
migrated all my email to mu4e.

In the next post, I'll describe how mu4e changed my life and my
approach to 'Inbox Zero'.
