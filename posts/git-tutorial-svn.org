I have used CVS and then [[https://subversion.apache.org/][SVN]] for version control. As I now use [[https://github.com/][GIT]] for
a couple of projects, I found this set of GIT [[https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials][tutorials]] very useful as
they are well-written, use plenty of examples and outline where and
how GIT differs from Subversion.
