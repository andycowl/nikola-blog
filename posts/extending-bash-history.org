#+END_COMMENT

I have used the Unix [[https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/][bash]] shell for many years. As I am incredibly lazy and
forgetful, I have become accustomed to using ctrl-r 'find' to find and scroll
though the latest 'find' commands I have issued.

Occasionally, I noticed that a lengthy, complex, useful 'find' command' (which I
mercilessly plagiarised from a clever person via Google) was no longer in my
shell history.

Investigations revealed the default bash history is a paltry 1000 commands so I
decided to increase this to 10000 by adding the following line to
'~/.bash_profile'.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
HISTFILESIZE=10000
#+END_SRC

After all, disk space is much cheaper than my time.
